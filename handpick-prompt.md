I have gh installed in this computer. the upstream folder is the main source of this project. this project itself is a fork of that main.

I put the upstream here for your convenient about what I want you to do.

I want you to find PR 1005 in that upstream (it is a git project itself) and implement it in this project as well.

This project is a fork of that upstream but I don't follow with every feature of the upstream and instead handpick some of them that I need.
