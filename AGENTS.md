# Intro

Omarchy is a set of bash scripts and configurations that delivers a full configured arch linux + hyprland for daily use.

## Origin

This is a Fork of Omarchy from https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy.

## Guidelines

- Don't run scripts on the development machine!
- Write less and modularized bash scripts for the given tasks.
- Use stable and well maintained open source software versions if is asked to install.
